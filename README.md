# Scramble CSV - real but fake

A Jupyter Notebook to scramble a CSV. When scrambled, no meaningful statistics can be performed.
It provides a good 'representative' dataset to test Extract, Transform, and Load, or for other
demonstrative purposes.

Functions:
* Can replace the key/ID with <tstxxxxxxxx>: id_column
* Can skip scrambling variables based on a list: dont_scramble
* Can remove variables based on a list: drop_variables
* Outputs a scrambled data set into a CSV

 ## Example
The Jupyter Notebook is setup with an example, run the Notebook yourself, or look at input/output:
* ./Source
* ./Scrambled
